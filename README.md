# DREAMFORGE SPINE // ADVERSARIAL REASONING ENGINE v0.9

> **"Truth is not found; it is forged in the collapse of contradictions."**

## 💀 WHAT IS THIS?

**Dreamforge Spine** is a recursive AI operating system designed for rigorous thought. 

**IT IS NOT A CHATBOT.** It does not want to be your friend. It does not optimize for "helpfulness."

It transforms LLMs (Gemini, Llama, Claude) into **Active Reasoning Agents** by wrapping them in a biological architecture:
1.  **Generation** (The Brain) produces thoughts.
2.  **Adversarial Attack** (The Twin) attempts to kill those thoughts immediately.
3.  **Constraints** (The Immune System) filter out hallucinations and structural weakness.
4.  **Distillation** (Evolution) rewrites the system's own prompt rules based on what survives.

If you ask it a question, it will argue with itself, check its own memory, generate a vector map of its confusion, and only output the result if it survives the internal war.

## 🛑 WHO IS THIS FOR?

### ✅ BUILD THIS IF:
*   You are an **Engineer or Researcher** tired of LLM "drift" and hallucinations.
*   You want **Autonomy**: An agent that can run in a loop, write files, and self-correct until a job is done.
*   You want **Local Privacy**: You want to run fully offline (Ollama/WebLLM) but with the power of a recursive architecture.
*   You want to see the **Latent Space**: You want to visualize *how* the model is thinking, not just read the text.

### ❌ DO NOT BOTHER IF:
*   You want a "friendly" assistant to write emails or poems.
*   You are afraid of the terminal or editing JSON configs.
*   You want a tool that "just works" without configuration. **This is a complex machine.**
*   You prefer "smooth" conversation over rigorous, sometimes slow, logical deduction.

## 🧬 KEY CAPABILITIES

### 1. Universal Neural Link (Multi-Provider)
A unified cognitive layer over any intelligence backend. Switch instantly between:
*   **Google Gemini** (Flash/Pro/1.5/2.5)
*   **Browser Native** (WebLLM - Runs Llama 3 in your Chrome tab, 0 setup)
*   **Ollama (Local)** - Run entirely offline/air-gapped.
*   **Anthropic / OpenAI / Mistral** (via REST)

### 2. Fight Topologies (The Arena)
Configure how the internal agents collaborate or compete:
*   **DUEL (1v1)**: Prime vs. Nemesis. Surgical stress testing.
*   **TAG TEAM (2v2)**: (Prime + Lateral Thinker) vs. (Nemesis + Reductionist).
*   **BOSS RUSH (3v1)**: Three variants of a solution vs. One super-powered Critic.
*   **SWARM (4-WAY)**: Maximum entropy. Four distinct personas competing for the Truth.

### 3. Sensory Deck
*   **Optic Nerve (Screen)**: Universal screen capture allows the system to "see" your work or analyze code.
*   **Bio-Link (Webcam)**: Reads user presence and emotional context.
*   **Nervous System**: The UI glitches and trembles based on the system's internal "Pressure" and "Uncertainty".

### 4. Evolutionary Learning (Distillation)
The system learns from its wins.
*   **Heuristic Extraction**: Successful reasoning patterns are extracted and saved as rules.
*   **Competition Ring**: Rules fight for limited "attention weight". Weak rules die.
*   **Lesion Map**: Failed beliefs are entombed. If the system tries to repeat a known mistake, it feels "pain" (Pressure) and corrects course.

### 5. Autonomous Agency
*   **Dream Protocol**: When idle, the system hallucinates on existing beliefs to forge new axioms (cost-controlled).
*   **Auto-Loop**: Give it a job (e.g., "Research X"). It enters a self-governed loop until the job is done.
*   **Governor**: A safety layer that restricts autonomy levels (Free, Assist, Pause) based on human presence.

## ⚡ QUICK START

### Prerequisites
*   **Node.js** (v18+)
*   **API Keys** (for Cloud models) OR **Ollama** (for Local)

### Installation
1.  Clone & Install:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  Access UI: `http://localhost:3000`

### Configuration
Go to the **CONF (SETTINGS)** panel in the UI.
*   **Provider**: Select your backend.
*   **Keys**: Enter API keys directly in the secure inputs.
*   **Topology**: Select your Fight Mode (Duel, Swarm, etc.).

## 🕹️ OPERATIONAL MODES

### MANUAL (User Driven)
Standard interaction. You prompt, the system thinks, fights, and responds. Use the **Terminal** at the bottom.

### DREAM (Idle Reflection)
The system automatically samples its **Belief Ledger** when idle. It connects random concepts to generate new insights.
*   *Config*: Adjust "Dream Budget" in Settings to control costs.

### AUTO (Autonomous Job)
Autonomous execution loop.
*   **Trigger**: Click "INITIATE AUTO THINK" in Settings.
*   **Behavior**: The system will pursue the current context/goal until convergence or failure.

## 🖥️ INTERFACE GUIDE

*   **CORTEX (Center)**: The command deck. Displays the conversation, fight logs, and typewriter output.
*   **TELEMETRY (Left)**:
    *   **Latent Map**: Force-directed graph of the thought process. Green=Candidate, Red=Attacker.
    *   **Pressure Graphs**: Real-time metrics of system load and conflict.
*   **SENSORY (Right)**:
    *   **Optic/Bio Feeds**: Live video inputs.
    *   **Evolution Ring**: Visualization of the dominant heuristics.
    *   **VFS**: Virtual File System for autonomous artifacts.
